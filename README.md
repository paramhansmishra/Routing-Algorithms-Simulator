# Routing-Algorithms-Simulator
Routing Algorithms Simulator is a Python Tkinter-based tool to visualize networking algorithms like Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Distance Vector. It lets users add nodes/edges, build custom topologies, and observe shortest-path routing in real time through an interactive GUI.
