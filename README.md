üõ∞Ô∏è Routing Algorithms Simulator

The Routing Algorithms Simulator is an interactive Python application designed to demonstrate how different routing algorithms work in computer networks. Built with Tkinter, this project provides a graphical environment where users can create custom networks, add or remove nodes and edges, and visualize how routing decisions are made in real time.

The primary motivation behind this project is to make learning and teaching of computer networking concepts more engaging. Instead of static diagrams, learners can actively simulate and observe the behavior of algorithms like Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Distance Vector as they compute shortest paths. This provides both an educational tool for students and a demonstration platform for professionals.

üîπ Features

Interactive GUI: Built with Tkinter, the interface allows users to dynamically add nodes, define edges with weights, and simulate network topologies.

Multiple Algorithms: Includes implementations of classical routing algorithms such as Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Distance Vector. The modular design allows easy extension to add more algorithms in the future.

Visualization: Real-time path visualization highlights how each algorithm processes the graph and determines shortest paths.

Modular Architecture: The project is organized into separate modules for algorithms, GUI, and visualization, ensuring clean code structure and scalability.

Educational Focus: Designed to bridge the gap between theoretical networking concepts and practical understanding through simulation.
